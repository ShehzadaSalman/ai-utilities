# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building an Express.js application that provides multiple endpoints for calendar management functionality. The application will integrate with Cal.com's API to handle time slot operations including retrieving available slots, reserving slots, and updating existing reservations. Additionally, the application will provide utility endpoints such as getting the current date.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to get the current date from the server, so that I can synchronize time-based operations and display current date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to the date endpoint THEN the system SHALL return the current date in ISO 8601 format
2. WHEN the date endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP status 200 for successful requests
3. WHEN the date endpoint encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate HTTP error status with error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve available time slots for a specific event type, so that I can display booking options to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to the available slots endpoint with valid event type parameters THEN the system SHALL return available time slots from Cal.com API
2. WHEN the request includes valid date range parameters THEN the system SHALL filter slots within the specified range
3. IF the Cal.com API returns an error THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN no slots are available for the given criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with HTTP status 200
5. WHEN required parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 400 with validation error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to reserve a time slot for an event, so that I can book appointments on behalf of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to the reserve slot endpoint with valid slot and user details THEN the system SHALL create a reservation via Cal.com API
2. WHEN the reservation is successful THEN the system SHALL return the reservation details with HTTP status 201
3. IF the slot is no longer available THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 409 with conflict details
4. WHEN required reservation parameters are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 400 with validation errors
5. IF the Cal.com API reservation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error status and message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to update an existing reserved slot, so that I can modify appointment details or reschedule bookings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is made to the update slot endpoint with valid reservation ID and update data THEN the system SHALL update the reservation via Cal.com API
2. WHEN the update is successful THEN the system SHALL return the updated reservation details with HTTP status 200
3. IF the reservation ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 404 with not found error
4. WHEN update parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 400 with validation errors
5. IF the Cal.com API update fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error status and message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle Cal.com API authentication securely, so that API calls are authorized and user data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate Cal.com API credentials are properly configured
2. WHEN making API calls to Cal.com THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
3. IF API credentials are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 401 with authentication error
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully with appropriate retry logic

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor application health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate detail level
2. WHEN external API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and response details
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with field-specific messages
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL log startup status and configuration validation results
